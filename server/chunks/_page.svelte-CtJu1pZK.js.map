Furry. \n      It was this joyful ball of fur, a true star in the making, that sparked our journey to create high-quality pet food. \n      About a decade ago, Furry's owner, Henrietta, discovered how challenging it was to find pet food with natural \n      and premium ingredients. One day, Furry fell ill, suffering from skin lesions and painful itching. Determined \n      to restore her health through better nutrition, Henrietta began cooking for her. After all, why shouldn't every \n      family member, whether human or not, enjoy the same quality food? Brimming with inspiration, Henrietta teamed up \n      with experts, veterinarians, and animal nutritionists to develop nourishing, delicious, and high-quality food for \n      all our four-legged friends. At Furry Fresh, \"quality\" means food made from freshly prepared premium meat (without \n      animal or meat meal) and naturally nourishing, delicious ingredients. With a successful recipe and many happy dogs, \n      Furry Fresh was born.</p> <div style=\"background-color: #A2D5C6; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;\"><h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Our Values</h2></div> <ul style=\"font-size: 1.5rem;\"><li><span class=\"icon\">ü•©</span> Meat as the #1 Ingredient</li> <li><span class=\"icon\">üçñ</span> Better Flavor for Pets</li> <li><span class=\"icon\">üè≠</span> Locally Produced</li> <li><span class=\"icon\">üå±</span> Organic Products</li></ul></section>`;\n}\nexport {\n  _page as default\n};\n"],"names":[],"mappings":"AACA,SAAS,KAAK,CAAC,SAAS,EAAE;AAC1B,EAAE,SAAS,CAAC,GAAG,IAAI,CAAC;AACpB;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA,ybAAyb,CAAC;AAC1b;;;;"}
